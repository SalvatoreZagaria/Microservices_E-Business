# Microservices_E-Business
Designing and implementing a Microservices Architecture for an E-business service. Just for fun.

There are several microservices running on several Docker containers. Every container is a Web server running thanks to Python scripts and the Flask framework. Also, every service owns its own database instance (MongoDB).
The Android App interfaces this whole back-end side through an API.
